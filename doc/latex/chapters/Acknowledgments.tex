% The data used by RoutViewer is geographic in nature i.e. contains location properties. These location properties may be subtle or obvious, and may refer to a variety of places in different contexts. The goal is to visualize these properties, so that users studying these behaviors can understand how and why people are behaving, as they are. This gives us a better understanding as to how to react after such an event, properties I am trying to visualize involves transportation modes, commutation links, evacuation information etc.

% Together these tools significantly improve the ability of an analyst to navigate through complex scenarios and simulation outputs. The tools were valuable in detecting errors in our simulations as well.
