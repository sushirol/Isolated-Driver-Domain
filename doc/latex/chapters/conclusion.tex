The thesis presented Isolated Device Driver (IDDR), a operating system which provides isolation between a device driver and Linkux kernel components by running device driver in the driver domain. IDDR is a re-implementation of the Xen's isolated driver domain. The work presented a spinlock based performance improvement technique in the IDDR system. The new IDDR system allows the application domain and driver domain to spin for requests and responses. This avoids the unwanted domain rescheduling for every request and response event notification.
