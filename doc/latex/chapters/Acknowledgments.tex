Firstly, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Godmar Back. Under his guidance, I have acquired knowledge across a broad spectrum of computer science topics. I greatly appreciate the time he has dedicated toward our weekly meetings. I would like to thank Dr. Keith Bisset and Dr. Madhav Marathe for supporting me throughout my masters. I would like to thank Dr. Cameron for his role as a committee member and offering Computer Architecture course, which helped me learn the fundamentals.
\\
Last but not least, I am grateful to my family for their exceptional love, support and encouragement.
